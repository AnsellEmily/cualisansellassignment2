  <tr>
    <td><b>1. Visibility of system status</b></td>
    <td>The search actions were predictable, inasmuch as the search function returned some relevant results. The system was highly responsive and returned results in good time for the required search terms (“fast food” and “Catholic”). There was no indication of status or a progress bar, but the search results were paginated. The search results seemed to be chronological. It would be more helpful for students to immediately access articles in order of their relevance to the search term, and for this to be indicated clearly.<p></p></td>
     </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>2. Match between system and the real world</b></td>
    <td>Searching for “fast food” and “Catholic” will return results including a thumbnail image, article title, date, and the first sentence of each article. The format of these results assisted the user to find images of “fast food” and “Catholicism” quickly, which students could also be reasonably expected to do. The system corresponded to “real world” expectations.<p></p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>3. User control and freedom</b></td>
    <td>When no search results are found, the user is encouraged to enter new search terms. When the results are not satisfactory, the user needs to begin a new search or use the back button to return to the homepage. This is not onerous or unexpected, and students could be expected to navigate this basic search functionality.<p></p></td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td><b>4. Consistency and standards</b></td>
    <td>The design includes a menu bar at the top of the page, which is consistent with expectations. The menu bar includes the search function. Archives by month are harder to find - the user needs to scroll down before locating them. Search results do not return short article summaries; instead, they quote the first sentence of each article which is not conventional. Some image links are broken, which is also unconventional.<p></p></td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td><b>5. Error prevention</b></td>
    <td>Searching for symbols of “fast food” and “Catholic”, students may not immediately find what they are looking for. They may need to refine their searches with advanced options, including Boolean operators, date, and subject searches. These search options are not currently available, which will require students to page through search results until they find what they’re looking for. Also, if students misspell words, the search function does not suggest other spellings or corrections.<p></p></td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td><b>6. Recognition rather than recall</b></td>
    <td>The “search result” terms ("fast food" or "Catholic"), remains clearly visible at the top of the page as the user scrolls through pages of search results. The layout and search term reminder reduce cognitive load for the user, who does not need to remember what they had searched for. The main menu remains visible at the top, making it easy to navigate away from the search results as needed. <p></p></td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td><b>7. Flexibility and efficiency of use</b></td>
    <td>Apart from the ability to subscribe, the site does not offer any personalization or customization options. Students will only need to search for symbols for “fast food” and “Catholic” for this assignment, but they may wish to customize the site for other purposes (they are students with an interest in the University). They may be more likely to use the site effectively in the future if it offers greater personalization, such as by customizing their homepage to their interests.<p></p></td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td><b>8. Aesthetic and minimalist design</b></td>
    <td>The site is very busy, and students will have to use it for a specific purpose (searching for symbols). They may be distracted by the flash news function, or the multiplicity of stories and images.<p></p></td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td><b>9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</b></td>
    <td>Searches that return no results do not suggest any way to recover from these errors apart from using different terms or returning to the homepage. The site should offer spelling corrections, advanced search, or recommendations of other linked terms. Students may become frustrated with the inability to recover from errors and the lack of solutions offered.<p></p></td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td><b>10. Help and documentation</b></td>
    <td>The site doesn’t offer any additional explanation or a help function to assist users. Since the site contains a significant archive of articles, it would be helpful to provide documentation assisting users to access the archive efficiently. Students would perhaps appreciate more guidance about the archive, since it likely contains images of symbols relevant to the assignment.<p></p></td>

</p>
The Tower website provides an opportunity to subscribe to a weekly email update. The subscription process is straightforward and delivers a predictable result consistent with “real world” expectations. Clicking on the “subscribe” button on the top menu bar opens a new page, branded recognizably as Catholic University but managed by a MailChimp system, where users are prompted to enter their email address and confirm their identity through a simple reCAPTCHA process. The site makes clear that the weekly email update will contain information about news, politics, arts and entertainment, and sports coverage as well as the frequency of communication (weekly). Completing the process results in a confirmation message and the option to return to The Tower website (which is still open in another tab), and an email confirmation message. The email confirmation message contains information about unsubscribing.

<b>Recognition rather than recall</b>
<p>
</p>
The Tower’s homepage includes a side menu of months in descending chronological order which returns all stories published in that month, and the search bar on the top menu returns accurate search results for simple terms. The site returns these results in good time, consistent with user expectations, and search results contain thumbnail images, article title, and date information which reduces the recall and cognitive effort load for the user. The search terms remain visible at the top of each page, as the user scrolls between different pages of search results.

Some image links were broken in the search results with no explanation. No help was immediately available for potential errors, such as an “advanced search” option where the user could enter more specific search terms or recommendations for how to search.

<b>Visibility of system status</b>
<p>
</p>
There was no indication of status or a progress bar, but the search results were paginated with the ability to click or tap different pages. For searches that returned a large number of results (e.g., “Catholic”), it was not possible to toggle between different pages beyond a selection of 9 page buttons in view; for example, the user could not toggle between page 11 and page 30 without tapping “next” 19 times. It was not clear how the results were organized, although it appeared to be chronological and not determined by the frequency of the search term in the article or its priority in the article’s metadata. This introduced an element of unpredictability.

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Part 2: Conduct a "mini-usability test"</h2>
<p>
</p>
<h4 style="font-family:verdana;">Step 4: Two tasks (observation form & questionnaire submitted separately) </h4>
<p>
</p>
<h4 style="font-family:verdana;">Step 5: Compare the results from Part 1 and Part 2 </h4>
<p>
</p>
The search function is a very important feature for users. Its accuracy influences user satisfaction significantly. Searching for “library science” did not return any relevant results, whereas searching for “fast food” and “Catholic” did, although the number of results for “Catholic” was very large. When results were not found, such as when the end-user searched for terms related to World War II, there was no way to refine the search through advanced options. It was possible to “redo” the action, granting user control and freedom, by entering new search terms. Successful search results were delivered in a consistent, standard manner with thumbnail images, article titles, dates and the first sentence of the article available to preview. Some image links were broken, however, which made it more difficult to gauge whether the article was relevant for search terms like “fast food” or “Catholic” such as when the lesson plan required students to search for visual symbols. 
<p>
</p>
From a predictability standpoint, the end-user appreciated the design of the 2024 site and its interactivity, including the “flash story” feature. This was consistent with his expectations of other news sites, and assisted his recognition rather than recall. He thought the 2020 pages were boring and plain, although when he found two stories about the Vietnam War he was quick to open them and read them. The aesthetic design of the site mattered less when he found what he was looking for. The archive menu was limited and it took the end-user some time before he realized that it only goes back to 2020 or so. He was puzzled by this, since the headline message around The Tower indicates that the paper has been in existence since 1922. He thought that this should have been clearer, with a link to the older archive if possible. This would have aided his search for historically distant events like World War II and the Vietnam War. Overall, the site did not always produce predictable interactions.
<p>
</p>
I recommend that the current website for The Tower provide more information about its historical archive, providing a link to later editions if possible. The search function could be augmented with advanced search options, such as date ranges and a subject search (news, entertainment, politics, etc.). It’s not clear whether the current search functionality can accommodate Boolean operators; since this is a University newspaper, it would be helpful to have them and consistent with a University audience’s expectations. Image links need to be repaired, since the thumbnails help users to locate useful articles. Each article should include a one-sentence summary with a defined number of characters, so that the text accompanying the thumbnails is more relevant (rather than simply quoting the first sentence, which is often incomplete). Finally, it should be easier to toggle between different pages of search results. Hopefully an advanced search would refine the results, but for any search returning more than 7 pages of results, it should be easier to click on different pages.
